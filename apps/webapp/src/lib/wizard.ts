/**
 * US-101 — Onboarding wizard model.
 *
 * answer → PlanInput note (AC#2 "every wizard answer is editable later in the
 * full inputs"). The wizard owns exactly four areas of the plan and nothing
 * else — wallets, savings split, allowances, horizon, assets, liabilities and
 * milestones stay exactly as the baseline set them:
 *
 *   wizard answer          PlanInput field                edit it afterwards
 *   salaryMonthly       →  incomes[] row "Salary"        dashboard → Income tab
 *   livingMonthly       →  expenses[] row "Living …"     dashboard → Expenses tab
 *   goals[]             →  goals[] (GoalRow)             dashboard → Goals tab
 *   retirementYear      →  retirementYear                dashboard → Retirement tab
 *   retirementMonthly.. →  retirementMonthlyToday        dashboard → Retirement tab
 *
 * Skipping a step keeps the baseline value for its fields — the wizard never
 * invents defaults, so "skip everything" lands on exactly the engine's TH
 * defaults from `defaultPlanInput()`.
 *
 * The wizard is re-runnable: `wizardAnswersFromPlan()` seeds it from the live
 * plan and `applyWizardAnswers(answers, plan)` writes back onto that same
 * baseline, so replaying the intro edits the plan instead of resetting it.
 *
 * No DOM / no storage here — storage helpers live at the bottom and are the
 * only browser-aware part (guarded, SSR-safe).
