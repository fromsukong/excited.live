# i18n Platform Skill

`packages/i18n` is the localization engine: pure TypeScript, bilingual EN + TH, no
network, no DOM, no framework. The webapp wires it into SSR through middleware and a
React context; the landing app handles its own copy with the same bilingual spirit.
This skill covers the package surface, the webapp wiring, and the conventions that
keep EN and TH consistent.

## 1. Package surface (`packages/i18n/src/index.ts`, 136 lines)

Workspace name `@excited-live/i18n`. Everything exported:

- `Locale = "en" | "th"`, `LOCALES: readonly ["en", "th"]`, `DEFAULT_LOCALE = "en"`
  (product launches EN-first in Thailand).
- `LocalizedLabel { en: string, th: string }`. The same structural shape exists in
  `packages/tax/src/types.ts`; both engines speak the same label so tax labels render
  with the same translator as UI strings.
- `Dictionary = Record<string, LocalizedLabel>`: stable keys, bilingual values.
- `isLocale(value): value is Locale` (exact "en"/"th" only).
- `toLocale(value)`: narrows unknown values (cookies, headers, storage). Trims,
  lowercases, splits on "-", and matches the BASE language: "th-TH" gives "th".
  Unsupported languages give undefined, callers apply their own default.
- `translateLabel(label, locale)`: the label lookup. TH falls back to EN when its
  string is empty ("th" empty means not translated yet: falls back visibly, not
  silently).
- `Translator { locale, t(key, vars?), label(LocalizedLabel) }`.
- `interpolate(template, vars?)`: fills `{name}` placeholders. Unknown names stay
  visible (the raw `{action}` remains in the text) so a bad call shows up in review
  instead of vanishing.
- `createTranslator(dictionaries, locale?)`: builds a translator. Dictionary lookup
  falls back to the EN dictionary, then to the key itself: a missing key renders as
  the key string ("nope"), deliberate and test-pinned so gaps are visible.
- Locale resolution helpers consumed by webapp middleware:
  - `LOCALE_COOKIE = "excited_live_locale"`.
  - `localeCookieValue(locale, { secure? })`: serializes
    `excited_live_locale=th; Path=/; Max-Age=31536000; SameSite=Lax` (+ "; Secure"
    when passed). Value is validated through toLocale.
  - `localeFromCookie(cookieHeader)`: parses the cookie header.
  - `localeFromAcceptLanguage(header)`: RFC 7231 parsing with q-values; highest
    quality wins, order wins ties, q=0 and unsupported tags drop, MALFORMED or
    out-of-range q invalidates that candidate entirely (never promoted by default),
    3-decimal precision enforced. Empty/no-match gives undefined.

## 2. Tests (`packages/i18n/src/index.test.ts`, 18 tests)

Pinned behavior: DEFAULT_LOCALE/LOCALES; isLocale and toLocale ("th-TH" base match,
case-insensitive " EN ", non-strings); translateLabel EN + TH and the empty-TH
fallback; createTranslator key resolution, key-as-fallback, EN-dictionary fallback
when a locale has no dictionary of its own, engine label() use, interpolation with
kept-unknown placeholders; Accept-Language: quality ordering ("fr-FR, th-TH;q=0.9,
en;q=0.8" gives "th"), order tie-break, unsupported languages, q=0, case-insensitive
q, whitespace, malformed and out-of-range q ("q=1e2", "q=1.5", "q=0.5foo"),
q precision 0.955 over 0.9, empty headers; cookie round-trip, multi-cookie headers,
"th-TH" cookie value, invalid values.

## 3. Webapp wiring: the request middleware (`apps/webapp/src/start.ts`)

`start.ts` builds the start instance; its request middleware are, in order: locale,
csrf, authkit (when configured), the auth guard (when configured and required; see
the `auth_workos` skill). The locale middleware:

1. Reads the `excited_live_locale` cookie.
2. Falls back to `Accept-Language` through `localeFromAcceptLanguage`.
3. Falls back to `"en"`.
4. Resolution order matters for the cookie write: only a FIRST VISIT (no cookie) with
   a non-EN locale appends a `set-cookie` header (`localeCookieValue(locale, {
   secure: true })`), guarded in try/catch so a cookie failure can never break
   rendering.
5. Exposes the resolved locale to routes via the middleware context (route context
   receives it as `serverContext.locale`).

An explicit cookie beats the browser header on every later request; the header only
decides the first visit.

## 4. Webapp wiring: route context and provider

`apps/webapp/src/routes/__root.tsx` (root route) does the handoff:

`beforeLoad` reads `serverContext?.locale` (attached by the middleware; typed loosely
because it is untyped upstream) or re-derives on the client: SSR gets the
middleware-resolved locale, client navigation re-derives from
`document.cookie` (localeFromCookie) or DEFAULT_LOCALE.

`RootComponent` wraps the tree in `<LocaleProvider initialLocale={locale}>`.
`RootDocument` renders `<AppDocument lang={locale} theme="light">`, so `<html lang>`
always matches the active locale.

`apps/webapp/src/lib/locale-context.tsx` supplies `LocaleProvider` and `useLocale()`
(throws outside a provider). The provider:

- Holds `locale` state seeded from `initialLocale`.
- On toggle, `setLocale` writes `document.cookie` via `localeCookieValue(next)` and
  sets state; no reload needed. The cookie then wins for the server on the next
  request and for the client through context.
- `t` comes from `getTranslator(locale).t` (the dictionary module below), memoized on
  `locale`.
- An effect keeps `document.documentElement.lang` in sync with the state (also covers
  client toggles after hydration).

## 5. Dictionaries (`apps/webapp/src/lib/dictionaries.ts`)

One dictionary, `strings: Dictionary`: stable keys ("app.title", "nav.plan",
"metric.netWorth", ...), each with `{ en, th }` and EN FIRST. Conventions in the
file header, enforced by review: keys are stable IDs; selection state uses keys,
never rendered text. Any UI never keys its logic off locale-specific text.

Consumers: `getTranslator(locale)` builds
`createTranslator({ en: strings, th: { ...strings, ...thOverrides } }, locale)`.
`thOverrides` exists (currently empty) so Thai-specific overrides can land without
touching EN strings. In components: `const { t } = useLocale()`.

## 6. Conventions worth a rule

- Bilingual labels everywhere: tax engine labels (`LocalizedLabel`), UI strings in
  dictionaries.ts, landing copy (data-lang spans): all carry en + th side by side.
- EN first field order (`{ en, th }`) matches packages/tax; keep it.
- Keys are stable IDs; selection state uses keys, never text (a Select options label
  rendered to Thai must not throw off option identity).
- Interpolation uses `{name}` placeholders; unknown names stay visible.
- Missing TH translations fall back visibly (translateLabel EN fallback; missing keys
  render the key itself) so gaps cannot hide. A missing key IS a bug though: add the
  key to dictionaries.ts in the same PR that consumes it.
- English source of truth: when you add a string, write EN once and translate; never
  duplicate EN copy into the TH field.

## 7. SSR locale flow end to end

Request reaches start.ts middleware → locale resolved (cookie, then header, then
"en"; cookie set on first visit) → route context exposes it → `__root.tsx`
beforeLoad picks it up → RootComponent wraps LocaleProvider → components consume
`useLocale().t` → client hydration starts from the SAME value: the middleware set the
cookie on first visit, and the client re-derives from that cookie if a fresh
navigation bypasses the SSR value.

Where it can drift, and how to check:

- Client paths that skip `beforeLoad` (rare in TanStack Start) or cached routes may
  hold a stale locale: check `document.documentElement.lang` AND the rendered text
  AND the cookie value agree.
- A locale toggle followed by a hard reload relies on the cookie: verify
  `excited_live_locale` is present and the SSR HTML (curl the route) matches the
  chosen language.
- A missing dictionary key: visible as the raw key string in the rendered page
  (grep the page source for `t("` style tokens if unsure).

## 8. The landing app has its own copy handling (verified)

`apps/landingpage` is Astro and does NOT import `@excited-live/i18n` (repo grep
against imports in the landing app is empty at authoring time). It supports two
languages differently:

- `WaitlistForm.tsx` holds COPY consts `{ en: {...}, th: {...} }` (EN first, same
  convention).
- `LangSelect.tsx` (client island) and pure-CSS toggles flip `<html data-lang>` which
  the inline boot script in layout.astro seeds from `localStorage['exl-lang']` BEFORE
  first paint; elements carry `data-lang-en` / `data-lang-th` span pairs.
- Detail (see the `landing_seo` skill): because SSR renders both spans and CSS hides
  one, the form's React state re-derives from the `data-lang` attribute on change
  (MutationObserver in WaitlistForm.tsx; LangSelect renders an empty trigger until
  synced to avoid flashing the wrong label after hydration).

Do not "migrate" landing copy to packages/i18n as a drive-by. The landing app is a
separate static surface; unify only if a spec asks for it, and carry the domain
knowledge first (the data-lang mechanics differ from the React context flow).

## 9. Commands

```bash
# Engine checks (what CI runs per package)
pnpm --filter @excited-live/i18n test      # vitest, 18 tests at authoring time
pnpm --filter @excited-live/i18n typecheck # tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @excited-live/i18n build     # tsup build
```

Compatibility: webapp typecheck covers `dictionaries.ts`, `locale-context.tsx`,
`start.ts` and `__root.tsx`:

```bash
pnpm --filter @excited-live/webapp typecheck
```

`@excited-live/i18n` has no runtime dependencies, so a fresh install typechecks with
no dist prebuild (no package needs to be built first).

## 10. Pitfalls

- Hydration mismatch: any locale source the server cannot see (localStorage,
  screen size, browser setting) is OFF-LIMITS for the initial React state. Only the
  middleware-resolved locale enters `initialLocale`; the client re-derives the SAME
  value from the cookie set during SSR. Never patch the client to read localStorage
  while SSR reads a cookie.
- Base-language matching: `th-TH` and `th_TH` and "TH" all match "th" through
  toLocale, but `localeFromAcceptLanguage` operates on the raw token through the
  same path, so a nonstandard Accept-Language entry like "th" plus "Q" casing still
  resolves to Thai. Add regression tests if you touch toLocale.
- Cookie flags: `localeCookieValue(locale, { secure: true })` for HTTPS-only
  deployments (start.ts middleware uses secure: true). If you serve http://localhost,
  the plain variant is fine: the param exists so dev loops can read the cookie.
- Never derive state from rendered text (e.g. reading the DOM to learn the locale);
  keys and the documentElement `lang`/`data-lang` attribute are the state.
- The landing app does not use packages/i18n; two systems are intentional. Read
  section 8 before "unifying" them.
- Engine labels: `LocalizedLabel` comes from packages/tax (types.ts); the i18n
  package defines the same shape. They are structurally compatible; do not import
  tax types into i18n or the reverse.
