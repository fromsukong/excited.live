# excited.live — Development Guide (for humans and agents)

Monorepo: pnpm + turbo. App lives in `apps/webapp` (TanStack Start + React 19, SSR). Tax engine in `packages/tax`.

## Commands

Run from repo root:

- Install: `pnpm install`
- Dev server: `pnpm dev` (webapp on :3000)
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Typecheck: `pnpm typecheck`
- Lint: `pnpm lint`

## API modes (mock vs live)

Build-time switch via `VITE_API_MODE`:

- `VITE_API_MODE=mock` — stubbed data. Safe default for local dev: no real keys, no real requests.
- `VITE_API_MODE=live` — real backend. Used for the PR `live` preview and all main/production deploys.

## Deploy

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`), direct-upload pattern (Cloudflare does NOT build — no build-count limit).

**Main webapp** (`apps/webapp` → Pages project `excited-live`):

- PR open/update → `preview.yml` → two preview deploys on project `excited-live`: `<sanitized-branch>-mock` and `<sanitized-branch>-live` aliases (`*.excited-live.pages.dev`). Branch names are sanitized first (lowercase, non-alphanumeric → `-`, dashes trimmed, max 23 chars so the suffix always fits Cloudflare's 28-char alias limit) — see the sanitize step in `.github/workflows/preview.yml`
- Merge/push to `main` → `prelive.yml` → auto-deploy to **prelive** project (`excited-live-prelive`, URL: excited-live-prelive.pages.dev → eventually prelive.excited.live)
- **Production** (`excited-live` project → excited.live) deploys ONLY via manual trigger: Actions → Deploy Production → Run workflow (requires typing PROD to confirm) (workflow_dispatch)

**Tax webapp** (`apps/tax-webapp` → Pages projects `excited-live-tax` + `excited-live-tax-prelive`): same 3-tier model via `tax-preview.yml` / `tax-prelive.yml` / `tax-production.yml` (paths-filtered to `apps/tax-webapp/**` and `packages/tax/**`, preview aliases on `*.excited-live-tax.pages.dev`). Tax previews are cleaned up by `tax-pr-cleanup.yml` and advertised in the PR body by `tax-pr-description.yml` — same shape as the main-app `pr-cleanup.yml` / `pr-description.yml`. The tax app imports `@excited-live/tax` (resolves to `packages/tax/dist`), so its CI builds with `pnpm exec turbo run build --filter=@excited-live/tax-webapp` (turbo builds the dependency chain first) instead of a bare in-app `pnpm build`.

Required repo secrets: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (shared by both pipelines).

Note: the tax app has no backend yet (all computation is client-side), so its mock/live preview builds are currently identical; the `VITE_API_MODE` split exists for pipeline symmetry and matters once a backend lands.

Pitfalls:
- Must use wrangler@4 (v3 esbuild can't compile the SSR function — `with {type: json}` syntax)
- The Pages Functions (`apps/webapp/functions/[[path]].ts`, `apps/tax-webapp/functions/[[path]].ts`) bundle `dist/server/server.js` — deploy jobs must run inside the app dir where both `functions/` and `dist/` exist
- CF projects need `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag (set on all four projects: `excited-live`, `excited-live-prelive`, `excited-live-tax`, `excited-live-tax-prelive`)
- The branch-name sanitization algorithm now lives in FOUR copies that must stay in sync (preview.yml, tax-preview.yml, pr-cleanup.yml, tax-pr-cleanup.yml) plus the JS copy in each pr-description workflow — if you change one, change all

## Conventions for agents (Hermes)

**AI agents: read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) first** — it is the canonical agent
contract (rules, definition of done, git safety for shared clones). The notes
below are a quick summary.

- Work on a branch, open a PR. Never push straight to main.
- Before starting a task: `git pull --ff-only` on main, branch from it.
- Verify your work: `pnpm build`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm lint` must pass before opening the PR (CI enforces lint with zero warnings).
- Keep the tax engine pure (no network, no DOM) — it lives in `packages/tax` and is shared.
- SSR: routes run server-side first; don't touch `window`/`document` at module top level.
- New user-facing text is bilingual: `{ en, th }`, EN-first. (The web UI is EN-only today; this rule applies to everything added from now on.)
